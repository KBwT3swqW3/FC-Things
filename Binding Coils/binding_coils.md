# FAQs
## Requirements/How to Unlock
To partake in the event all that's required is that you have unlocked the ARR raid
`The Binding Coil of Bahamut - Turn 1` the steps to accomplish that are outlined
in the steps below

### Finish A Realm Reborn
To unlock the Binding Coils of Bahamut you must first Complete the main ARR main
story quest line `The Ultimate Weapon`, this is the final quest in the base ARR
MSQ and you can check if you've done it by:

* Opening your `Quest Journal`
* Clicking the button marked `Complete` at the top of the quest list
* Clicking on the `Magnifying Glass` labelled `Quest Search`
* Entering `The Ultimate Weapon` into the search box and hitting enter

### Complete the Hard Versions of Ifrit, Garuda and Titan
These trials are required before you're able progress beyond the patch 2.5 
content, you can pick them up from Urianger in the Waking Sands (Western Thanalan
(11.6, 13.8)), the first quest in the quest line is named `A Recurring Problem`
followed up by  `Ifrit Bleeds, We Can Kill It`, then `In for Garuda Awakening`
and finally `In a Titan Spot`

Despite their name they're not much harder than the normal versions, hard really
means, in the case of these trials, that they're 8 man trials

### Primal Awakening Quest Line
Once the previous two tasks have been completed you can pick up the 
`Primal Awakening` quest line from Urianger in the Waking Sands (Western
Thanalan (11.6, 13.8)). This quest line is the start of the Binding Coils of
Bahamut and will eventually lead to the unlocking of the first `Turn` of the
raid series

## What Is Expected of You
All that's required is your attendance, beyond that the only other thing we'd
ask of you is your patience. The Binding Coils story line is fairly lengthy as
most raid series story lines are, and these are story runs

It's important to remember that everybody reads and takes in information at
different speeds and everyone has a right to enjoy the content. The Binding
Coils suffers from the fact that it follows the old ARR mindset of having
cut scenes mid dungeon and so it's important to not rush on ahead and
accidentally trigger another cut scene whilst somebody is still watching the
previous one

By the same token, the cut scenes do require clicking through so please try
not to spend over long keeping others waiting around

TL;DR

* Be patient people read at different speeds and the quest line is long
* Try not to hold people up by not clicking through the quest dialogue
* Don't rush ahead and trigger additional cut scenes in the dungeons before
everyone has had a chance to view them
